# To-do List

__This is a project that I wrote as a part of Jetbrains Academy Python developer track.__
Link: https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2

## How to run:

There are two ways to run this app.

1. Run the app as an executable: `python -m todolist`
2. Run the file _todolist/todolist.py_: `python todolist.py`

This project is my first try at building a working executable package.
